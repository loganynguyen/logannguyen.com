				<strong>👋 Hi there!</strong> Welcome to my little corner of the internet.<br><br>
				Since you're here, it's possible that you might be a <i>slightly</i> interested as to who I am.
				Yes, my name is in fact Logan Nguyen. I live in the United States and I am currently a medical student at Wayne State University School of Medicine.
				Previously I studied both Biochemistry and Computer Science as an undergradate (also at WSU).
				In my spare time, I've been working on an open source electronic medical record called
				<a href="https://github.com/symotif/rchart" target="_blank" class="hover:bg-purple-200"><span class="text-gradient"><strong><u>rchart</u></strong></span></a>.
				It's currently quite solidly in its early stages of development, but please feel free to check it out and considering contributing!
				I really do appreciate any help and/or feedback.
				Besides medicine and coding, I honestly feel like I have too many interests, yet throughout the years I have always enjoyed music, nature, making things, and stories of all kinds.
				I'll try to share some of my thoughts and experiences on those topics here on my website when I have the time.
